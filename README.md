web application that creates an online catalog for a small library, where users can browse available books and manage their accounts.

Main fetures are:

  models for books, book copies, genre, language and authors.
  Users can view list and detail information for books and authors.
  admin users can create and manage models. The admin has been optimised (the basic registration is present in admin.py, but commented out).
  librarians can renew reserved books
